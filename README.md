# container-images

Container images for everyone hosted at https://hub.docker.com/r/k8sathome

## why?

- Semantic versioning is awesome
- s6-overlay is not awesome
- ARM architectures are gaining popularity
- Multiple architecture support (amd64, arm64, armv7)
- Simplicity over complexity (e.g. only ubuntu:focal)
